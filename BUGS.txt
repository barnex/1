[0001] SOLVED  arne:
 When retrieving the magnetization from the GPU, e.g., to save output, a CUDA error may occasionally be thrown. The CUDA error report says nothing about the cuda_memcpy() that originally caused it. E.g.: a CUFFT error: "the user passed an invalid plan pointer" may be thrown because the plan was (probably) corrupted by the memcpy(). The problem is not 100% reproducible and seems to depend on the exact timing. It can be worked around by saving output at slightly different times or even in a different order (e.g., first save a table and then a png file instead of vice-versa).

 Solution: runtime.LockOSThread(). Probably the go png encoder uses goroutines which causes the CUDA context be accessed by a thread that didn't create it.


[0002] OPEN arne:
 We can not handle big simulations yet:
 make3dconf(), cufft() fail and we allocate to much memory as well.

[0003] OPEN arne:
 simulate crashes on empty input file or on directory as input.
