TODO (Arne)

* it seems CUFFT allocates memory for its FFT plans, check if this is a lot!
* bigfft
* higher-order solvers
* dashboard:
   time     ETA
   step     out
   time     dt
   steptime performance
   Bx, By, Bz
   mx, my, mz
* check if input parameters make sense and are set before sim.init() (size, material, ...)
* replace all panic() calls by clear error messages
* save log file
* should warn when alpha=0
* tensor package is not idiomatic Go. Should use [][][]float as much as possible and cast it to a tensor only when needed.
