TODO (Arne)

* use the permissions of the parent directory!
* precise time steps on demand.
* more table output: max m, dm/dt etc, possibly on-demand, calculated on gpu?
* save m "filename"
* cluster queue scripts: rmall UNFINISHED (includes running, but also when only the dir was made), rmall crahsed, status, ...
* do not use os.Exit() but sim.Exit() which removes running file -> replace by "crashed" or something
* when sim daemon is killed it should clean up its unfinished output dir
* when sim daemon child process crashes, it should either clean up (but not run it again) or rename the status file to crashed
* it seems CUFFT allocates memory for its FFT plans, check if this is a lot!
* bigfft
* higher-order solvers
* dashboard:
   time     ETA
   step     out
   time     dt
   steptime performance
   Bx, By, Bz
   mx, my, mz
* compatibility with OOMMF ovf format so people can use existing tools.
