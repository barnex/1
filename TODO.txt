TODO (Arne)

* "running" file in output dir should indicate sim is running
* when sim daemon is killed it should clean up its unfinished output dir
* it seems CUFFT allocates memory for its FFT plans, check if this is a lot!
* bigfft
* higher-order solvers
* dashboard:
   time     ETA
   step     out
   time     dt
   steptime performance
   Bx, By, Bz
   mx, my, mz
* tensor package is not idiomatic Go. Should use [][][]float as much as possible and cast it to a tensor only when needed.
