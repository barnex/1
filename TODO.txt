TODO (Arne)

* save m "filename"
* alphabetic sorting of files looked at by daemon
* cluster queue scripts: rmall running, rmall crahsed, status, ...
* do not use os.Exit() but sim.Exit() which removes running file -> replace by "crashed" or something
* when sim daemon is killed it should clean up its unfinished output dir
* it seems CUFFT allocates memory for its FFT plans, check if this is a lot!
* bigfft
* higher-order solvers
* dashboard:
   time     ETA
   step     out
   time     dt
   steptime performance
   Bx, By, Bz
   mx, my, mz
* tensor package is not idiomatic Go. Should use [][][]float as much as possible and cast it to a tensor only when needed.
* compatibility with OOMMF ovf format so people can use existing tools.
