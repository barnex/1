TODO (Arne)

* check if input parameters make sense and are set before sim.init() (size, material, ...)
* replace all panic() calls by clear error messages
* save log file
* should warn when alpha=0
* tensor package is not idiomatic Go. Should use [][][]float as much as possible and cast it to a tensor only when needed.
