  abstract = {The time structure of synchrotron radiation allows time resolved experiments
	with sub-100 ps temporal resolution using a pump-probe approach.
	However, the relaxation time of the samples may require a lower repetition
	rate of the pump pulse compared to the full repetition rate of the
	x-ray pulses from the synchrotron. The use of only the x-ray pulse
	immediately following the pump pulse is not efficient and often requires
	special operation modes where only a few buckets of the storage ring
	are filled. We designed a novel software defined photon counting
	system that allows to implement a variety of pump-probe schemes at
	the full repetition rate. The high number of photon counters allows
	to detect the response of the sample at multiple time delays simultaneously,
	thus improving the efficiency of the experiment. The system has been
	successfully applied to time resolved scanning transmission x-ray
	microscopy. However, this technique is applicable more generally.

  journal = {Nature},
  year = {2007},
  volume = {447},
  pages = {190--193},
  abstract = {Chirality is a fascinating phenomenon that can manifest itself in
	subtle ways, for example in biochemistry ( in the observed single-handedness
	of biomolecules(1)) and in particle physics ( in the charge-parity
	violation of electroweak interactions(2)). In condensed matter, magnetic
	materials can also display single-handed, or homochiral, spin structures.
	This may be caused by the Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya interaction, which
	arises from spin - orbit scattering of electrons in an inversion-asymmetric
	crystal field(3,4). This effect is typically irrelevant in bulk metals
	as their crystals are inversion symmetric. However, low-dimensional
	systems lack structural inversion symmetry, so that homochiral spin
	structures may occur(5). Here we report the observation of magnetic
	order of a specific chirality in a single atomic layer of manganese
	on a tungsten ( 110) substrate. Spin-polarized scanning tunnelling
	microscopy reveals that adjacent spins are not perfectly antiferromagnetic
	but slightly canted, resulting in a spin spiral structure with a
	period of about 12 nm. We show by quantitative theory that this chiral
	order is caused by the Dzyaloshinskii - Moriya interaction and leads
	to a left-rotating spin cycloid. Our findings confirm the significance
	of this interaction for magnets in reduced dimensions. Chirality
	in nanoscale magnets may play a crucial role in spintronic devices,
	where the spin rather than the charge of an electron is used for
	data transmission and manipulation. For instance, a spin-polarized
	current flowing through chiral magnetic structures will exert a spin-torque
	on the magnetic structure(6,7), causing a variety of excitations
	or manipulations of the magnetization(8,9) and giving rise to microwave
	emission, magnetization switching, or magnetic motors.},

	calculated based on a continuum theory for the magnetization. This
	theory assumes that the absolute magnetization value is constant
	in space and time. Dynamics is usually described with the Landau-Lifshitz-Gilbert
	(LLG) equation, the stochastic variant of which includes finite temperatures.
	Using simulation techniques with atomistic resolution we show that
	this conventional micromagnetic approach fails for higher temperatures
	since we find two effects which cannot be described in terms of the
	LLG equation: (i) an enhanced damping when approaching the Curie
	temperature and, (ii) a magnetization magnitude that is not constant
	in time. We show, however, that both of these effects are naturally
	described by the Landau-Lifshitz-Bloch equation which links the LLG
	equation with the theory of critical phenomena and turns out to be
	a more realistic equation for magnetization dynamics at elevated
	temperatures.},

	bias and the uniaxial shape anisotropy has been systematically investigated
	in nanometer-sized lines of Ni80Fe20/FeMn bilayers using the magneto-optic
	Kerr effect for different orientations of the applied magnetic field.
	The measurements exhibit peculiar magnetic behavior when the exchange
	bias, the uniaxial anisotropy, and the applied magnetic field are
	not collinear. When the applied magnetic field is perpendicular to
	the exchange bias, the magnitude and the orientation of the uniaxial

	the shift of the hysteresis loop changes nonmonotonically with the
	orientation of the applied magnetic field and exhibits a maximum
	loop shift that exceeds the value that would be expected from the
	interface coupling alone. A simple modified coherent rotation model
	provides a good description of the behavior of the hysteresis loops
	in these patterned exchange bias systems. These results show clearly

	all other magnetic anisotropies in order to extract meaningful conclusions

	Co oxide matrix containing ferromagnetic Co clusters. Magnetization
	measurements were performed in a temperature range from 300 down
	to 5 K, at applied magnetic fields up to 30 kOe. The exchange bias
	value at 5 K for the strongly oxidized sample is 4.8 kOe against
	the value of 0.75 kOe for the less oxidized sample. The mean values
	of the thicknesses of the Co oxide layers are estimated to be 0.6
	and 0.3 nm for the more and less oxidized sample, respectively. We
	propose a method of measuring the exchange bias inducing temperature,
	i.e., the temperature at which exchange anisotropy is established.
	We determined the mean inducing temperatures for both samples, which
	are 55 and 25 K, respectively, for the more and less oxidized samples.
	Both temperatures are well below the bulk CoO Neel temperature of
	292 K. A low value of the inducing temperature of the Co oxide layer
	is a consequence of its subnanometer thickness, while a large exchange
	bias value is a consequence of different dimensionality of Co clusters

  abstract = {Exchange bias, referred to the interaction between a ferromagnet (FM)
	and an antiferromagnet (AFM), is a fundamental interfacial magnetic
	phenomenon, which is key to current and future applications. The
	effect was discovered half a century ago, and it is well established
	that the spin structures at the FM/AFM interface play an essential
	role. However, currently, ad hoc phenomenological anisotropies are
	often postulated without microscopic justification or sufficient
	experimental evidence to address magnetization-reversal behavior
	in exchange-bias systems. We advance toward a detailed microscopic
	understanding of the magnetic anisotropies in exchange-bias FM/AFM
	systems by showing that symmetry-breaking anisotropies leave a distinct
	fingerprint in the asymmetry of the magnetization reversal and we
	demonstrate how these emerging anisotropies are correlated with the
	intrinsic anisotropy. Angular and vectorial resolved Kerr hysteresis
	loops from FM/AFM bilayers with varying degree of ferromagnetic anisotropy
	reveal a noncollinear anisotropy, which becomes important for ferromagnets
	with vanishing intrinsic anisotropy. Numerical simulations show that
	this anisotropy naturally arises from the inevitable spin frustration
	at an atomically rough FM/AFM interface. As a consequence, we show
	in detail how the differences observed for different materials during
	magnetization reversal can be understood in general terms as originating
	from the interplay between interfacial frustration and intrinsic
	anisotropies. This understanding will certainly open additional avenues
	to tailor future advanced magnetic materials.},

	The next step is to simulate this spin model by using the stochastic

	in continuously varying magnetizations as proposed by Zhang and Li.
	The standard problem geometry is a permalloy cuboid of 100 nm edge

  abstract = {It is reported that focused-ion-beam (FIB) processing causes considerable
	grain growth in magnetic thin films, which may be a concern for the
	use of this technique in recording head pole trimming. Two magnetic
	thin films (NiFe and FeCoN) were used to examine FIB-induced grain
	growth. NiFe showed more significant grain growth with grain size
	increasing from similar to20 to similar to500 nm after FIB etching
	with a dose of 0.15 nC/mum(2). The grain size in the FeCoN films
	increased from similar to20 to similar to100 nm at the same dose.
	It was found that the NiFe films fibbed with the same ion dose (0.15
	nC/mum(2)) and different beam currents (99, 672, and 1500 pA) experienced
	similar grain growth, suggesting that the grain growth is driven
	by momentum transfer rather than local heating. Grains in the NiFe
	films often had an elongated shape rather than circular and many
	crystallographic twins were observed in the FIB images, and confirmed
	with transmission electron microscopy. These twins tended to be parallel
	to the fast axis of beam rastering, while the axis of elongation,
	if present, tended to be along slow axis of rastering. It was found
	that the ratio of pixel space to beam diameter controls this behavior.
	It was revealed that values of this ratio less than 0.5 resulted
	in elongated or "acicular" grains. For fibbed FeCoN films, no acicular
	grains or twins were observed. This is believed to be due to the
	difference in crystal structure and twinning planes of the face-centered-cubic
	and body-centered-cubic structures. Both fibbed films showed magnetic
	degradation in the form of reduced moment and/or increased coercivity,

	imaging (time resolution: 70-100 ps) of magnetization dynamics at
	soft x-ray microscopes (lateral resolution down to 20 nm). Stroboscopic
	pump-and-probe experiments were performed on micron-sized Permalloy
	samples at a full-field magnetic transmission x-ray microscope (XM-1,
	beamline 6.1.2) at the ALS at Berkeley, CA. Complementary to these
	time-domain experiments a frequency-domain "spatially resolved ferromagnetic
	resonance" (SR-FMR) technique was applied to magnetic x-ray microscopy.
	In contrast to time-domain measurements which reflect a broadband
	excitation of the magnetization, the frequency-domain SR-FMR technique
	allows for detailed studies of specific ferrornagnetic eigenmodes.
	First SR-FMR experiments at a scanning x-ray transmission microscope
	(STXM, ALS, BL 11.0.2) are reported. The sample, a 1 X 1 mu m(2)
	Permalloy pattern, was excited by an alternating magnetic field with
	a frequency of 250 MHz. By varying the phase relation between the
	sine excitation and the x-ray flashes of the synchrotron, the dynamics
	of a vortex motion eigenmode was investigated in time and space.

  abstract = {A magnetic vortex is a curling magnetic structure realized in a ferromagnetic
	disk, which is a promising candidate for a memory cell for future
	non-volatile data-storage devices(1). Thus, an understanding of the
	stability and dynamical behaviour of the magnetic vortex is a major
	requirement for developing magnetic data-storage technology. Since
	the publication of experimental proof for the existence of a nanometre-scale
	core with out-of-plane magnetization in a magnetic vortex(2), the
	dynamics of vortices have been investigated intensively(3-10). However,
	a way to electrically control the core magnetization, which is a
	key for constructing a vortex-core memory, has been lacking. Here,
	we demonstrate the electrical switching of the core magnetization
	by using the current-driven resonant dynamics of the vortex; the
	core switching is triggered by a strong dynamic field that is produced
	locally by a rotational core motion at a high speed of several hundred
	metres per second. Efficient switching of the vortex core without
	magnetic-field application is achieved owing to resonance. This opens
	up the potentiality of a simple magnetic disk as a building block

	of z-components of spins (easy plane anisotropy), on square lattices,
	under the influence of a rotating in-plane (IP) magnetic field. Switching
	of the z-component of magnetization of the vortex is studied in computer
	simulations as a function of the magnetic field's amplitude and frequency.
	The effects of the size and the anisotropy of the system on the switching
	process are shown. An approximate dynamical equivalence of the system,
	in the bulk limit, to another system with both IP and OP static fields
	in the rotating reference frame is demonstrated, and qualitatively
	the same switching and critical behavior is obtained in computer
	simulations for both systems. We briefly discuss the interplay between
	finite size effects (image vortices) and the applied field in the
	dynamics of OP vortices. In the framework of a discrete reduced model
	of the vortex core we propose a mechanism for switching the vortex
	polarization, which can account qualitatively for all our results.
	A coupling between the IP movement (trajectories) of the vortex center
	and the OP core structure oscillations, due to the discreteness of
	the underlying lattice, is shown. A connection between this coupling

  abstract = {Thin submicron magnetic cylinders can have a vortex ground state,

	a rich spectrum consisting of the subgigahertz gyrotropic mode as

	of the normal modes are obtained analytically within the basis of
	the vortex-magnon interaction, including both exchange and the magnetostatic
	interaction to obtain the structures and frequencies of these modes.
	It is remarked that the modes can be classified according to an azimuthal
	integer eigenvalue, m corresponding to the number of azimuthal nodes,
	with the gyrotropic mode belonging to the vertical bar m vertical
	bar=1 class. In this paper the higher frequency vertical bar m vertical
	bar=1 modes are also investigated. Analytic calculation shows that
	the mode frequency is an approximately linear function of root L/R
	(where L is the cylinder thickness and R is the cylinder radius)
	for small values of the aspect ratio, with deviations from linearity
	as the aspect ratio increases. Time-resolved Kerr microscopy imaging
	of the dynamic magnetic structure (excited by an in-plane pulse)
	in single permalloy cylinders of radii from 250 to 1000 nm indicates
	that the calculated frequencies are close to the measured frequencies.
	Finally, the azimuthal node is also observed, showing that the high
