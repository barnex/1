\section{Installation}

\subsection{Requirements}

\subsubsection{Operating system}

This program was devolped and tested on Ubuntu Linux 10.04 64-bit. We expect it to run on most Linux distributions supported by CUDA (Fedora, RedHat, OpenSUSE, SUSE). It should in principle be possible to compile it on other Unix-like systems, perhaps with minor modifications to the make scripts or source files. You are welcome to report issues or submit patches for other platforms.

\subsubsection{Hardware}

To take advantage of the GPU acceleration, you need a \idx{CUDA capable} \textsc{NVIDIA} GPU. All recent \textsc{NVIDIA} GPUs should work, though it is highly recommended to use a ``Fermi''-architecture GPU with a \idx{compute capability} of at least 2.0 like the GeForce GTX series, Quadro 4000 or later, Tesla *2050 or later. For more info see \url{http://www.nvidia.com/object/cuda_gpus.html}

\subsubsection{Drivers}

You will also need to install the proprietary \textsc{NVIDIA} graphics \idx{driver}. This driver may already be installed on your system. E.g., under Ubuntu, the ``Hardware drivers'' program may propose to install this driver. You should try to run a simulation on the GPU -- if that works, it means your driver is up to date.

Otherwise, you can install the driver located in \file{dep/cuda}. You have to install it when your X-server is not running: logout from your grahpical session, then use the ``\idx{Console login}'' of your login manager (or press Ctrl-Alt-F1) to obtain a text console. Log in and \cmd{cd} to \file{dep/cuda} the \prog root directory. Type \cmd{sudo ./devdriver\_3.1\_linux\_64\_256.40.run}\footnote{Or \cmd{sudo ./devdriver\_3.1\_linux\_32\_256.40.run} on a 32-bit system.}\footnote{Possibly a later version of this driver may be present} and follow the instructions. Then reboot your computer. Note that you may have to re-install this driver after every kernel upgrade. To check your system, you can run the progam \idxcmd{nvidia-settings} which shows information about your GPU and driver.


\subsection{Setup}

We recommend downloading a pre-compiled version of the program for either a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture. You can place the \prog directory anywhere on your system.
