\section{Getting started}

\subsection{Requirements}

\subsubsection{Operating system}

This program was devolped and tested on Ubuntu Linux version 10.04, and we expect it to run on most Linux distributions. It should in principle be possible to compile it on any Unix-like system, perhaps with minor modifications to the make scripts or source files. You are welcome to report issues or submit patches for other platforms.

\subsubsection{Hardware and drivers}


To take advantage of the GPU acceleration, you need a CUDA capable \textsc{NVIDIA} GPU. All recent GPUs should be fine, though it is highly recommended to use a ``Fermi''-architecture GPU with a \idx{compute capability} of at least 2.0.
