\section{Installation}

\subsection{Requirements}

\subsubsection{Operating system}

This program was devolped and tested on Ubuntu Linux version 10.04, and we expect it to run on most Linux distributions. It should in principle be possible to compile it on any Unix-like system, perhaps with minor modifications to the make scripts or source files. You are welcome to report issues or submit patches for other platforms.

\subsubsection{Hardware and drivers}

To take advantage of the GPU acceleration, you need a \idx{CUDA capable} \textsc{NVIDIA} GPU. All recent GPUs should work, though it is highly recommended to use a ``Fermi''-architecture GPU with a \idx{compute capability} of at least 2.0.

You will also need to install the proprietary \textsc{NVIDIA} \idx{driver}. Under Ubuntu, the ``Hardware drivers'' program will probably propose to install this driver. You can also download the driver directly from \textsc{NVIDIA}. In that case you will have to install it when your X-server is not running and you will have to re-install it after every kernel upgrade.

To check your system, run the progam \cmd{nvidia-settings} which shows information about your GPU and driver.


\subsection{Setup}

We recommend downloading a pre-compiled version of the program for either a 32-bit or 64-bit architecture.
