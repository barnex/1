\section*{Introduction}

The \mumax micromagnetic simulator is currently in a \emph{beta}-stage which means it is open for testing and generally usable but there may be small issues. In this stage feedback by the users is very important and we encourage you to report problems and requests to \url{Arne.Vansteenkiste@UGent.be} and/or \url{Ben.VandeWiele@UGent.be}.


\mumax is open source under the GNU Public License v.3. This basically means the code can be edited and distributed but must remain open under this same license. See Appendix \ref{gpl} for more details.
