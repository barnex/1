# (2) Geometry
# ____________

# To define the geometry, you must specify exactly 2 out of these 3 statements:
#
# gridsize Nx Ny Nz          # defines the number of FD cells
# partsize SizeX SizeY SizeZ # defines the total magnet size, in meters
# cellsize SizeX SizeY SizeZ # defines the size of each FD cell, in meters
#
# When 2 of these sizes are specified, the 3d one is caluclated automatically.
# It is most usual to define the partsize and gridsize, and have the cellsize be calculated automatically.
#
# Note: the gridsize should preferably contain highly factorable numbers,
# like powers of 2 or small multiples of powers of two.
# E.g.: a 128 x 256 x 4 gridsize will run much, much faster than a 101 x 223 x 3 grid.
#
# Note: For 2D simulations, use Nx x Ny x 1, not 1 x Nx x Ny
#

# (3) Initial magnetization
# _________________________

# There are several commands to set the initial magnetization:
# A previously stored magnetization state can be loaded with "loadm filename":
#
# loadm myfile.tensor
#
# Also, there are a few pre-defined configurations available:
#
# uniform   mx my mz  # sets a uniform state, e.g.: uniform 1 0 0
# vortex    circ pol  # sets a vortex state with given circulation and polarization, e.g.: vortex 1 -1
#
# Finally, an existing magnetization can be changed as follows:
#
# addnoise  amplitude # adds random noise to break the symmetry, e.g.: addnoise 0.01
# 

#relax
