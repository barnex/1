1. First of all it seems like nvcc (as a fork of Open64) conflicting with AMD's 
Open64. So, if you have AMD's Open64 installed on your system then nvcc fails. 
Issue could be resolved simply by erasing the AMD Open64.

2. nvcc and gcc frequently report "No new line at the end of the file" and 
threat this like an error. By simply echo/sed to the entire sources resolves 
the issue.
