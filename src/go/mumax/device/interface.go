// The device.Interface makes an abstraction from a library with
// basic simulation functions for a specific computing device
// like a GPU or CPU (or possibly even a cluster).
//
// The interface specifies quite a number of simulation primitives
// like fft's, deltaM(), memory allocation... where all higher-level
// simulation functions can be derived from.
//
// Gpu is the primary implementation of the Device interface:
// eachs of its functions calls a corresponding C function that does
// the actual work with CUDA.
//
// The GPU implementation can be easily translated to a CPU alternative
// by just putting the CUDA kernels inside (openMP) for-loops instead of
// kernel launches. This straightforward translation is wrapped in
// Cpu
//
// The first layer of higher-level functions is implemented in device.go
//
// By convention, the methods in the Device interface are unsafe
// and therefore package private. They have safe, public wrappers
// derived methods device.go. This allows the safety checks to
// be implemented only once and not for each Device.
